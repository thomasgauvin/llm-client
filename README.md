# LLM Client

A simple LLM Client, written in React and hosted with Cloudflare Workers' Static Assets. Conversations happen on your device, directly to your LLM provider.  

## Context

I've been wanting a simple, browser-based client for LLM providers to experiment building different interaction modes with LLMs. This is the first iteration of that project. More LLM providers and interaction modes planned.
